# Polaris: Loop Detection with IDAPython and CLIPS Prototype

This was a proof of concept I included with my 2008 Virus Bulletin paper. The goal was to show that driving binary analysis via Expert System AIs could simulate much of the work done by human researchers. I chose to demo loop detection as this was a well-known problem and common to many aspects of binary analysis (recognizing encryption/decryption code, packing routines, etc).
